#### Satellite Data
Satellite descriptions and [ephemeris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris) are sourced from [Space-Tracker](https://www.space-track.org) a site maintained by the [Joint Functional Component Command for Space](https://www.stratcom.mil/factsheets/7/JFCC_Space/). The [satellite-js](https://github.com/shashwatak/satellite-js) JavaScript library is used to convert the downloaded [TLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element_set) file into geographic locations.

Below, showing all 14,024 man-made satellites. Geostationary satellites are highlighted in red and the 24 hour trajectory is displayed for the [ESA](http://www.esa.int/ESA) satellite [GIOVE-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIOVE#GIOVE-B).
